== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does TagMahal find tags for a post? =

TagMahal uses the Flaptor Autotagger API - [Flaptor Autotagger](http://tagger.flaptor.com "Autotagger Homepage") - to find tags for a post. 
Flaptor Autotagger uses a learning algorithm based on a set of training documents tagged by humans.

= What languages does it support? =

Currently, Flaptor Autotagger only supports English. 
We are working on other languages, Spanish is next on our list.

= I'm having problems with the plugin: it finds no tags or doesn't seem to update the tags when I change the post text =

If you're using a custom post editor (FCKEditor for instance) TagMahal won't be able to read your posts text
until you save it.  

== Installation ==

Copy the tagMahal.php into your wordpress plugins folder.
Enable the plugin.
